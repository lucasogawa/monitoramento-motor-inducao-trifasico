# Monitoring of Three-Phase Induction Motors

This repository contains code developed for the undergraduate thesis of the Computer Engineering course at Universidade Tecnológica Federal do Paraná.

Electrical and mechanical quantities such as RMS, DHT, speed and torque are important to determine the time to perform the maintenance of electric motors. Although there are tools capable of using such quantities for this purpose, they usually perform the visualization of this information on dedicated devices or desktops terminals. In this repository, we present a system, comprising a server and a mobile application, capable of enabling the visualization of the magnitudes of three-phase induction motors. Our application could run comfortably on a mobile device, since the calculations that require greater processing capacity are performed on the server.
